GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                   Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) [2024] [Shreyas Kashyap]
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
 a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
 under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
 refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
 means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
 that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
 either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
 language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
 the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
 running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
 is not restricted, as long as the output itself is not a derivative
 of the Program. However, having fun while youâ€™re doing it is highly
 encouraged!

 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
 source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
 conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
 copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
 notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
 and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
 along with the Program.

 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for
 a fee.

 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

   a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

   b) You must cause any work based on the Program to be licensed
 as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
 License.

   c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
 when run, you must cause it, when started running for such an
 interactive session, to print or display an announcement including
 an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no
 warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that
 users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and
 telling the user how to get a copy of this License. (Exception:
 if the Program is interactive but does not normally print such an
 announcement, your work based on the Program need not make it
 print such an announcement.)

 3. You may also copy and distribute the Program or modified version
 in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
 above provided that you also do one of the following:

   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
 source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

   b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
 years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
 cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
 machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
 distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
 customarily used for software interchange.

 This option is only valid if you do not distribute the Program in
 object code or executable form. 

 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
 except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
 otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program
 is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
 License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
 from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
 so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore,
 by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
 and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
 modifying the Program or works based on it.

 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
 Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
 to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
 this License.

 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do
 not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence
 you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
 then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be
 to refrain entirely from distribution.

 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
 the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
 those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in those
 countries where the Program is not thus restricted. 

 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
 of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
 detail to address new problems or concerns. 

 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published
 by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
 version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
 published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
 author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by
 the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
 we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided
 by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of
 our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
 generally.

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN WRITING.
 THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS
 IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
 INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
 COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
 writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may
 modify and redistribute the Program as permitted above, be liable to
 you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or
 consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Program
 (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate
 or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Program to
 operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been
 advised of the possibility of such damages.
